# Website_Scraping
This web scraping project extracts data from a specific Wikipedia page, specifically, the "List of largest companies in the United States by revenue." It scrapes and retrieves information about the largest companies in the United States based on their revenue and then organizes this data into a structured format using Python and libraries like BeautifulSoup and pandas. The resulting output is a tabular representation of the companies' details, making it easier to analyze and work with the data.
